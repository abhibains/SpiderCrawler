# Welcome to SpiderCrawlerüï∏Ô∏è!

This is a web crawler that I developed using PHP! It implements the BFS first search to visit the graph of internet html pages connected to each other via hyperlinks. 


# Files

 **Search.php** provides with an interface to interact with the crawler and acts a search engine for files at the local machine. User search the webpages for particular keywords and the crawler presents the list of hyperlinks to pages containing those keywords.  

### Generated files

The crawler generates bunch of files like *url_index.txt*, *index_keywords.txt* and some other files that can be used by a page ranking algorithm.
